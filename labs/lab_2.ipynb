    "3. **Termination Strategy**: Decides when the conversation should end\n",
    "4. **Chat History**: The shared conversation context visible to all agents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversation flow is typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User adds a message to the group chat\n",
    "2. Selection strategy chooses which agent responds next\n",
    "3. Selected agent processes the conversation history and generates a response\n",
    "4. Response is added to the chat history\n",
    "5. Termination strategy checks if conversation should end\n",
